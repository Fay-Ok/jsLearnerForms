# Javascript Fluency Forms

The concept of forms was borrowed from martial arts. Instead of solving new problems over and over
in hopes that the language will stick, a form is intended to be repeated movement for movement to 
develop a relationship with the language and practices of a fluent developer. The student at each 
form level will learn to identify syntactic patterns while following an intentional and regimented
process to promote fluency through a repeated process.

A student of any form will know they are ready to move to the next form when they can demonstrate
proficiency in the current form by applying the techniques presented without referring to the 
example materials. No two programmers are alike so it is understood that the steps someone would
follow may vary slightly. This variance is good as it demonstrates a deeper understanding of the
ideas presented in the form.

All of the first three forms will use the same tests and will address the questions posed in the
tests in the same order. For any proficiency check, the student will be expected to work through the
tests by reading them and then providing an appropriate response.

As a student becomes more conversant in a particular form, they are encouraged to apply their knowledge
using code katas, like the problems provided by [Exercism.io](http://exercism.io/).

## Skills covered per form

This section will be updated as forms are completed and ready for use.

### First Form

- Strict mode Javascript
- Immediately Invoked Function Expressions
- Exporting a module


- Function creation
- Conditional statements
- Calling a function
- Interaction and use of function parameters
- String concatenation
- Mathematical operations and operators
- Built in modules such as the Math module
- Built in functions such as toString and valueOf
- Adding or overriding functions on objects
- Looping
- Arrays
- Nested logic

Good reinforcement exercises from Exercism.io include:

- Leap

- Bob

Strong first form students will be challenged by these exercises:

- Gigasecond (The Date api is necessary for this problem)
- Word-count
- Pangram
